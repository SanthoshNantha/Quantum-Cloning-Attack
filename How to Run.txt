Here are the instructions on how to run your Qiskit QKD Eavesdropping Simulation mini-project, assuming you've already pushed it to GitHub.

How to Run Your Qiskit QKD Simulation Project
This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, getting the code from GitHub, and running the simulation.

1. Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Git: For cloning the repository from GitHub. You likely have this if you used Git Bash. If not, download it from git-scm.com.

Conda (Miniconda or Anaconda): This is highly recommended for managing Python environments and dependencies, as we used it previously. Download Miniconda from docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.

2. Get the Code from GitHub
First, you need to get the project files from your GitHub repository to your local machine.

Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal/command prompt).

Navigate to the directory where you want to store your project (e.g., Documents or Desktop).

Bash

cd /c/Users/YourUser/Documents/
# Replace 'YourUser' with your actual Windows username
Clone the repository: Replace YourUsername and YourRepositoryName with your actual GitHub username and the name of the repository you created (e.g., Qiskit-QKD-Simulation).

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
This will create a new folder named YourRepositoryName containing your qkd_eavesdropping.py file.

Navigate into the cloned project directory:

Bash

cd YourRepositoryName
# Example: cd Qiskit-QKD-Simulation
3. Set Up the Python Environment
It's crucial to use a dedicated Python environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. We'll recreate the qiskit10 environment you used before.

Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10 (if you don't already have qiskit10 set up correctly):

Bash

conda create --name qiskit10 python=3.10 -y
If you already have qiskit10 and are sure it's clean, you can skip this step.

Activate the environment:

Bash

conda activate qiskit10
Your terminal prompt should now show (qiskit10) at the beginning, indicating the environment is active.

4. Install Project Dependencies
Now, install the necessary Python libraries within your activated qiskit10 environment.

Install Qiskit and Qiskit Aer:

Bash

pip install qiskit qiskit-aer --no-cache-dir
Install Matplotlib:

Bash

pip install matplotlib
5. Run the Simulation Script
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run your QKD simulation.

Ensure your qiskit10 environment is still active and you are in your project directory (e.g., YourRepositoryName).

Execute the Python script:

Bash

python qkd_eavesdropping.py
6. Expected Output
The script will print the following to your terminal:

Messages indicating Alice's preparation, Eve's interception, and Bob's measurement.

ASCII art representations of the quantum circuits.

"Eve's Measurement Results (counts):" showing the distribution of her measurement outcomes (e.g., {'0': 510, '1': 514}).

"Bob's Measurement Results (counts):" showing the distribution of his measurement outcomes (which will be similar to Eve's, indicating the disturbance).

A histogram plot will pop up in a separate window, visually comparing Eve's and Bob's measurement distributions.

You'll observe that both Eve and Bob measure roughly a 50/50 chance for '0' and '1'. In a real QKD protocol, this discrepancy (Alice sending a known state, but Bob receiving a disturbed one) would be the signal that an eavesdropper is present.
